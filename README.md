Algoritmos-I
============

Repository for practical works developed during the subject Algorithms and Data Structures I. In this subject were treated topics like:

* Program Specification using contracts(pre and post conditions)
* Algebraic and abstract data types
* Basic functional programming and recursion
* The List data type and problem solving using lists
* Functional programs termination proofs, usually via induction.
* Basic imperative programming using C++. 
* The Array data type.
* Basic pointers and dynamic memory usage.
* Loops - Construction, termination and correctness.
* Floyd-Hoare logic for programs correctness
